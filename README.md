# Fake News Detector
This repository contains a Python-based solution for detecting fake news, employing machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The project is designed to classify text as real or fake news using a web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to input text and receive a classification on the fly.
# Features
Web Application: A Streamlit-based interface that allows users to input news text and evaluate its authenticity.
Data Preprocessing: Implements various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming to prepare data for modeling.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression to predict whether the news is fake or real.
Interactive Notebook: Includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the data preparation and model training process.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Streamlit
Jupyter if you want to explore the notebook
